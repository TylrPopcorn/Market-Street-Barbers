```Book yourself a haircut online with Market Street Barbers.```

Market Street Barbers is a modern barbershop booking website, originally designed in **[Figma](https://www.figma.com/)** and then converted into **[Svelte.js](https://svelte.dev/).** It features a seamless online booking system, a beautifully crafted UI, and a responsive layout that highlights the shopâ€™s story, team, and services. This project demonstrates the process of transforming a high-fidelity design into an interactive and optimized web experience using Svelte.js, ensuring both performance and aesthetics.
